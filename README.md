**[Unified 2](https://github.com/th3dstudio/UnifiedFirmware/releases) Firmware Migration Progress**

As we move machines from using this Unified 1 to [Unified 2](https://github.com/th3dstudio/UnifiedFirmware/releases) we will remove the config options for those machines and place a note stating that they are now to use Unified 2 instead.

If your machine is supported in [Unified 2](https://github.com/th3dstudio/UnifiedFirmware/releases) please use that instead of Unified 1.

**When will X printer be moved over?**

The answer is when we have time. We prioritize the more popular machines over the ones that are more niche/unpopular.

We have one person that does all the firmware work in addition to running the company. If you wish to have a machine moved over quicker you are welcome to help out by making the code yourself and making a pull request against the Unified 2 firmware github repo.

**The issues queue has been disabled as some people do not understand it's for firmware problems and not technical support.**
